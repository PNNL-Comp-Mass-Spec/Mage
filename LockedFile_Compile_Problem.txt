I occasionally see this error when compiling the application:
	Unable to copy file "obj\Debug\MageExtractor.exe" to "bin\Debug\MageExtractor.exe". 
	The process cannot access the file 'bin\Debug\MageExtractor.exe' because it is being used by another process.	MageExtractor

One poster suggests this occurs when you re-compile the application too quickly after closing it.

The most straightforward solution appears to be to not use [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.4.*")] in the AssemblyInfo.cs file 
and instead use a fixed version number, e.g. [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.4.1")]
